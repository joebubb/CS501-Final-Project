# CS501 Final Project - AI-Powered Journaling App  

## 📝 Introduction  
Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and personal growth, but many people struggle with consistency and knowing what to write. We decided to make a journaling app that makes the process more engaging.  

It will incorporate **AI-generated prompts** and **motivational features**. Similar to the app *BeReal*, each journal entry has a **photo to capture the moment** before the user starts writing.  

## ✨ Features  
- **AI Guidance:** The app provides AI-generated prompts to help users when they don't know what to write.  
- **Push Notifications:** Reminders ensure users stay consistent with their journaling habit.  
- **Streak System:** Encourages users to keep journaling regularly.  
- **Calendar View:** Allows users to revisit past entries.  
- **Delayed Commenting:** Enables reflection on older journal entries.  
- **Memories Feature:** Similar to *Snapchat Memories*, the app resurfaces journal entries from the same date in previous years, creating a nostalgic and reflective experience.  
- **AI Reflections:** For deeper insights, AI will analyze past journal entries and provide personalized feedback and self-improvement suggestions.  

## 📸 Photo-First Journaling  
The app **utilizes the device’s camera**, requiring users to take a **photo before starting a journal entry**. This ensures users capture a **real-life moment** before writing, making each entry more meaningful.  

## 🏗️ Backend & AI Integration  
The backend of the app will be built using **Firebase** as the database to store:  
- User accounts  
- Journal entries  
- Push notification data  

**Firebase Cloud Messaging** will handle reminders, ensuring users are notified at their preferred journaling time.  

The **Gemini API** will power AI features, including:  
- Generating **writing prompts**  
- Providing **reflections** on past journal entries  

## 📱 Target Platforms  
Testing will focus on **smartphones** and **tablets**:  
- **Phones** are ideal for quick entries and effortless photo capture.  
- **Tablets** offer a **larger screen** for a more immersive writing experience.  

The interface will be designed to **adapt to different device sizes and orientations**.  

## 🏠 User Experience  
- **Home Screen:** A **calendar-based** interface where users can access past entries.  
- **Bottom Navigation Bar:** Quick access to journal entries, streak tracking, and settings.  
- **New Entry Flow:**  
  1. **Capture a photo** 📸  
  2. **Write freely or generate an AI prompt** ✍️  
  3. **Receive AI-generated reflections** 🤖
